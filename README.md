# leetcode

**Goal:** learn algorithms and data structures with Python

## Guidelines:
* 1 hour to solve as many problems as I can
  * Read and make sure I understand the problem
  * 15-20 min to try to solve the problem
  * If I come across a new pattern/algorithm, take time to research and learn it (switch to study phase)
* Start with easy problems and work my way up
* If cant solve the problem, check the solution
  * Look at discussions and YouTube videos for explanations and really understand the thought process and logic
  * Run the solution and go over each line of the code and look at what it does for various test case inputs
  * Write notes and thoughts (even comment) and revisit the same problem after a week or month and solve it on my own without looking at the solution
* Read discussions tab top posts to gain more insights. Also, check general discussion posts that have information about a certain sub topic and bookmark them
* Write down and keep notes on Github repository. Also document ideas.
* Tip: use visualization. Drawing a picture helps a lot.
